### SWAT - Smart Web Application Testing

SWAT is a code-less UI testing automation tool for web application, which helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app. SWAT is designed to implement and maintain you test automation more easily. 

With the web mining technology, SWAT understands the interaction of web pages, so that you can implement and maintain the automation without writing/modify code against the view layer or DOM. SWAT also follows the BDD (Behaviour-driven Development) methodology, so that you can write user stories as and executable acceptance criteria.

We are offering SWAT cloud service for a more accessible and flexible use. SWAT server is also available as an package that can be run on a private server.

What can I use SWAT for?

#### Acceptance test

SWAT supports building you test scenarios on the level of business domain without the need for knowledge of web page implementation. It is easy for the designers instead of engineers to write the test scenario for acceptance test. With the automation, you can usually run your acceptance test as a regression test to ensure that there is no degrade in your latest release.

SWAT also supports integration with Jenkins so that you can build a CI process with acceptance test.

#### Browser compatibility test

SWAT provides local execution server based on Selenium WebDriver and support running scenarios on your local OS/browser combinations of desktop and mobile devices. It is easy to test whether the rendering or action of javascript of your web application is correct on the specific OS/browser by just running your scenarios on different platforms. 

SWAT cloud service also supports running scenarios on [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com), a public cloud execution service. You can easyly test you web application on 300+ platforms without need to build or maintain execution platforms.


Why SWAT?
---

* Not requiring test engineers to build the test scenario and case.
* Relieving the pain of maintaining the test ware by automatic knowledge analysis. 
* Realising unified management and easy-to-use user experience with management server + web application user interface.
* Supporting execution on various OS/browser combinations of desktop and mobile devices.
* A more flexible monthly subscription SaaS model with low rate for both cloud service and package.

How does SWAT work?
---

SWAT adopts "Scenario-building & Replay" approach to realise the automation of UI testing automation for web application. Instead of capturing scenarios, modifying generated script and running the script, you need to do the following steps to make an test with automation.

1. Import page HTML captures to SWAT 
SWAT's knowledge engine analyses web pages and extracts all the interactive operation models.
2. Build Scenario
Test designers build scenarios with the operation models.
3. Run Scenario
SWAT's knowledge engine explains and executes the scenarios.

Who should work on SWAT?
---

The answer may depend on the style of your current development/test process.

The biggest difference between SWAT and other automation tools/framework is that SWAT enables business analyst/designers instead of developers to complete the automated test. However, knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and some development skills are required to run a good automation practice. So, in the case of traditional waterfall development team, we strongly recommend that there is at least one test engineer in the swat test team.

In an agile team, as the process is a much simpler, every members can work on SWAT to do the test. And "Scenario-building & Replay" mechanism of SWAT can save much precious time of writing/modifying test code for developers.
